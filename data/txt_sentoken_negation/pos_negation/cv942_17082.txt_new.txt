it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . 
of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . 
payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . 
the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't NOT_know NOT_yet . 
all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't NOT_a NOT_happy NOT_chappy NOT_and NOT_is NOT_hellbent NOT_on NOT_getting NOT_the NOT_money NOT_stolen NOT_from NOT_him NOT_back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . 
it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . 
obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . 
porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . 
gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't NOT_mind NOT_beating NOT_up NOT_or NOT_shooting NOT_people NOT_to NOT_get NOT_what NOT_he NOT_wants . 
you probably wouldn't NOT_see NOT_other NOT_actors NOT_in NOT_his NOT_salary NOT_range NOT_take NOT_such NOT_an NOT_offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't NOT_be NOT_doing NOT_anything NOT_like NOT_this NOT_in NOT_a NOT_hurry NOT_after NOT_what NOT_happened NOT_the NOT_last NOT_time NOT_he NOT_tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . 
harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't NOT_mention NOT_further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? 
this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . 
while he isn't NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_character NOT_you NOT_wouldn't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_get NOT_on NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_side NOT_of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . 
porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . 
payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't NOT_be NOT_remembered NOT_as NOT_being NOT_among NOT_gibson's NOT_most NOT_important NOT_work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . 
the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? 
the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't NOT_ring NOT_true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . 
the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . 
a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . 
just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .
