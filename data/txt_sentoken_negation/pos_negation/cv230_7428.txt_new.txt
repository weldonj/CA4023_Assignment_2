well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started . 
so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era . 
with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' 
i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' . 
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . 
i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't NOT_see NOT_or NOT_think NOT_that NOT_once NOT_during NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_film . 
i get bored easily and this film didn't NOT_bore NOT_me NOT_for NOT_a NOT_minute . 
another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about " well thats not really possible . " 
you know what ? 
i couldn't NOT_give NOT_a NOT_bloody NOT_damn NOT_if NOT_it's NOT_possible NOT_or NOT_not , really i couldn't . 
it's a freaking movie and i don't NOT_want NOT_reality NOT_thrown NOT_in NOT_my NOT_face . 
i want to be able to see the impossible , the all might " what if " to many reviewers have seen one to many movies ! 
the special effects are the second star to this feature . 
they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground . 
they did an incredible job and come oscar time ( if they remember ) some notice better be thrown there way .
