i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago . 
i guess my memory really sucks . 
there is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack . 
the laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't NOT_that NOT_great . 
caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club . 
michael o'keefe plays said caddy . 
why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me . 
the movie doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_have NOT_a NOT_real NOT_plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . 
the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course . 
most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success . 
bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted . 
the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't NOT_even NOT_crack NOT_a NOT_smile NOT_on NOT_my NOT_face NOT_with NOT_his NOT_character's NOT_lame NOT_zen-like NOT_approach NOT_to NOT_golfing . 
there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie . 
i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid . 
i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper . 
nothing about this movie works . 
it wouldn't NOT_have NOT_taken NOT_a NOT_genius NOT_to NOT_figure NOT_out NOT_that NOT_this NOT_thing NOT_wasn't NOT_going NOT_to NOT_fly . 
most of the scenes just couldn't NOT_possibly NOT_be NOT_funny . 
it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world . 
i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny . 
in reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch . 
there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the " hot babe " of the movie walking by in her bikini . 
olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl . 
everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned . 
maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny . 
but for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack .
