the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it's about and why it's good or bad . 
i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen " get carter " i really can't NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_what NOT_it's NOT_about NOT_although NOT_i NOT_could NOT_go NOT_on NOT_and NOT_on NOT_about NOT_how NOT_and NOT_why NOT_it's NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie . 
" get carter " falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room . 
you might call them the " steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers . " 
you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development . 
they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at . 
sylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother's funeral . 
he believes his brother ? richie was " taken out " and didn't NOT_die NOT_from NOT_a NOT_dwi NOT_accident . 
carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid . 
his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his " rambo-on-testosterone-therapy " voice . 
stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't NOT_realize NOT_he's NOT_mocking NOT_himself . 
the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death . 
he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well . 
mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) . 
there's also another plot involving richie's mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter's still-living relatives . 
i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible . 
i could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all . 
i don't NOT_like NOT_to NOT_put NOT_spoliers NOT_in NOT_my NOT_reviews NOT_either NOT_intentionally NOT_or NOT_accidentally . 
yes , " get carter " is just that complicated and complex . 
and what's worse is that it's not this intricate to make it seem smart like " the usual suspects " for example - just the opposite . 
you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn't NOT_remember NOT_what NOT_had NOT_already NOT_happened NOT_and NOT_didn't NOT_figure NOT_out NOT_how NOT_each NOT_scene NOT_would NOT_lead NOT_in NOT_to NOT_the NOT_next NOT_one NOT_or NOT_how NOT_the NOT_major NOT_plot NOT_points NOT_would NOT_work NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_climax . 
all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn't NOT_a NOT_complete NOT_idiot NOT_he NOT_could NOT_have NOT_figured NOT_it NOT_out NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_five NOT_minutes . 
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another . 
making a movie entirely about criminals doesn't NOT_necessarily NOT_mean NOT_they NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_unlikable NOT_and NOT_cliche NOT_cutout NOT_characters . 
mel gibson starred in " payback " a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_like NOT_him NOT_even NOT_though NOT_he NOT_was NOT_just NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_a NOT_guy NOT_as NOT_jack NOT_carter . 
so ultimately " get carter " fails for pretty much every selling point it has . 
carter is not a likable character and you really don't NOT_care NOT_if NOT_he NOT_gets NOT_revenge NOT_or NOT_not . 
the action sequences are not at all exciting or original . 
the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon , you know who's going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) . 
in the end you don't NOT_feel NOT_nearly NOT_satisfied NOT_with NOT_the NOT_results . 
the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible . 
* the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining .
