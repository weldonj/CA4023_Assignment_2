" ladybugs " is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield . 
this picture doesn't NOT_play NOT_like NOT_a NOT_comedy NOT_for NOT_children , so who is it aimed at ? 
and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? 
rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation . 
he obviously doesn't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_self NOT_esteem NOT_and NOT_thinks NOT_he NOT_has NOT_to NOT_kiss NOT_up NOT_to NOT_get NOT_ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team . 
what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less . 
i didn't NOT_laugh , but for some reason it didn't NOT_annoy NOT_me NOT_that NOT_much . 
chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams . 
jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) . 
what we get is just another retread of the " underdog sports team " mixed with some cross dressing . 
unfortunately , the film isn't NOT_smart NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_play NOT_upon NOT_the NOT_drag NOT_aspect . 
in fact , it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable . 
could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ? 
he only wears a girl's wig , without any makeup , and they don't NOT_even NOT_give NOT_him NOT_falsies . 
brandis doesn't NOT_bother NOT_to NOT_mimic NOT_a NOT_girl's NOT_voice NOT_either . 
then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ? 
martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ? 
just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on . 
when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss . 
this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) . 
there's just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters . 
i've seen worse movies than " ladybugs , " but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn't NOT_seem NOT_as NOT_bad NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is . 
dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price .
