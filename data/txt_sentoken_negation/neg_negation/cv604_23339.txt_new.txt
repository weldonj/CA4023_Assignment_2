an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices . 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow . 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source . 
the acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie . 
a few things about the story didn't NOT_sit NOT_very NOT_well NOT_with NOT_me NOT_for NOT_example NOT_the NOT_original NOT_scam NOT_and NOT_cover-up NOT_heavily NOT_involved NOT_the NOT_character NOT_played NOT_by NOT_sharon NOT_stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better . 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot . 
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing . 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener . 
all these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough . 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions . 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_look NOT_at NOT_horseracing NOT_and NOT_make NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_out NOT_of NOT_it ) . 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this . 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't NOT_interesting NOT_enough NOT_on NOT_its NOT_own NOT_to NOT_have NOT_this NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_flavoring NOT_and NOT_directorial NOT_touch NOT_about NOT_it . 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't NOT_like NOT_it . 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't NOT_evolve NOT_enough NOT_and NOT_wasn't NOT_captivating NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_simpatico NOT_an NOT_enjoyable NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_watch . 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't NOT_find NOT_it NOT_good NOT_even NOT_though NOT_i NOT_see NOT_the NOT_merits NOT_and NOT_style NOT_used NOT_and NOT_can NOT_compliment NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_on NOT_them . 
i wouldn't NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_anyone NOT_but NOT_if NOT_you NOT_are NOT_a NOT_horse NOT_fanatic NOT_or NOT_a NOT_racing NOT_fanatic NOT_then NOT_you NOT_will NOT_most NOT_likely NOT_enjoy NOT_this NOT_movie .
