movies can do the two big es very well : educate and entertain . 
in the best of all possible worlds , they accomplish both . 
on the red planet , they fail entirely . 
in the near future , a manned mission is sent to mars to observe primitive plant growth . 
this film does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how exciting watching algae grow would be . 
after some mumbo-jumbo about an ecological disaster on earth and an interminable wait to reach the fourth planet , the ship falls apart almost as fast as the movie does . 
the ground crew of people you couldn't NOT_care NOT_less NOT_about NOT_is NOT_trapped NOT_on NOT_the NOT_surface NOT_without NOT_food , water or air and stalked by a deadly rogue cyberdog . 
the one potentially interesting character ( carrie-anne moss ) spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer . 
attempting to graft " 2001 " esque space mysticism with " terminator " robot horror , first time director antony hoffman can't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_figure NOT_out NOT_what's NOT_going NOT_on . 
neither can we . 
didn't NOT_he NOT_have NOT_anyone NOT_who NOT_could NOT_step NOT_back NOT_from NOT_the NOT_shooting NOT_and NOT_make NOT_sure NOT_there NOT_was NOT_a NOT_coherent NOT_story ? 
couldn't NOT_he NOT_have NOT_used NOT_the NOT_money NOT_saved NOT_by NOT_only NOT_having NOT_to NOT_pay NOT_half NOT_a NOT_dozen NOT_actors NOT_to NOT_hire NOT_a NOT_scriptwriter ? 
there are so many mis-steps . 
every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction . 
why introduce the theme of faith vs . science if the crewman who could comment on it disappears early only to die _offscreen_ ? 
the audience begins the film waiting for something to happen . 
two hours later , they're still waiting . 
despite our greatest hopes , there is no life on the red planet .
