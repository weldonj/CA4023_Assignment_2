what were they thinking ? 
nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough , but do we really need an eighties film ? 
robbie hart ( adam sandler ) used to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he's singing at weddings and having a good time . 
a romantic at heart , he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high-school sweetie . 
when she leaves him waiting at the altar , his tune changes to " love stinks " . 
he meets waitress julia ( drew barrymore ) who is engaged to a junk-bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together . 
in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie . 
sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role , but there is no spark . 
barrymore doesn't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_convey NOT_anything NOT_other NOT_than NOT_a NOT_pretty NOT_face NOT_with NOT_nothing NOT_behind NOT_it : beauty but no attitude . 
both characters are just there . 
bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . 
the eighties are shoved in our face . 
references to deloreans , madonna , " dallas " , ivana and donald , burt and loni and " miami vice " get old fast . 
the filmmakers must have realized that there wasn't NOT_much NOT_entertainment NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story NOT_and NOT_thought NOT_they NOT_could NOT_dazzle NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_with NOT_humorous NOT_period NOT_allusions . 
they're not funny and it doesn't NOT_work . 
with change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don't NOT_you NOT_think NOT_we NOT_could NOT_have NOT_more NOT_than NOT_14 NOT_years NOT_before NOT_we NOT_yearn NOT_for NOT_the NOT_past . 
maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino . 
( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be . )
