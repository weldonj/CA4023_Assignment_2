there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it . 
then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes . 
writer-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category . 
weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters , herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories . 
hitmen lee ( james spader ) and his partner dosmo ( danny aiello ) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox ( teri hatcher ) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked . 
an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops , ( jeff daniels ) and wes ( eric stoltz ) . 
a murder is not vice territory , flirting with asian prostitues is , but wes would rather play inquisitive detective . 
meanwhile , washed-up director , teddy ( paul mazursky ) is about to end his life . 
but before he can do that , he must find a good home for his dog . 
enter nurse audrey ( marsha mason ) , who takes the dog and teddy for a ride . 
stuffy art dealer , allan hopper ( greg cruttwell ) has kidney stones . 
while struggling about his fancy house , he switches between moaning in self-pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary's ( glenne headly ) plain appearance . 
don't NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_if NOT_you NOT_find NOT_yourself NOT_asking NOT_more NOT_than NOT_once NOT_just NOT_what NOT_the NOT_hell NOT_is NOT_going NOT_on . 
you might like that feeling of cluelessness . 
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes . 
the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't NOT_stunning NOT_by NOT_any NOT_means NOT_though . 
the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts , even though they are interesting and funny . 
funny , that is if you aren't NOT_comparing NOT_them NOT_to NOT_the NOT_likes NOT_of NOT_tarantino's NOT_pulp NOT_chcaracters . 
the tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of ( director's name ? 
guy who also did last seduction ) red rock west . 
two days isn't NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie NOT_but NOT_there NOT_isn't NOT_much NOT_else NOT_to NOT_it NOT_than NOT_the NOT_screenplay NOT_novelty NOT_of NOT_the NOT_linkage NOT_of NOT_seemingly NOT_unrelated NOT_characters . 
it'll keep you guessing alright but you won't NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_answers NOT_five NOT_minutes NOT_after NOT_the NOT_credits . 
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
* * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! 
* * * pretty good , bring a friend . 
* * * * amazing , potent stuff . 
* * * * * perfection . 
see it twice .
