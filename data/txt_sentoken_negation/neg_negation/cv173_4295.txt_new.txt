i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . 
luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ! 
i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't NOT_help NOT_myself . . . 
i got it . 
well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't NOT_dish NOT_out NOT_$7 NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_three NOT_hours NOT_of NOT_my NOT_time NOT_sitting NOT_in NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_theatre NOT_watching NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie . 
this movie really sucks . 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! ! 
for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail . 
the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all . 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up . 
i didn't NOT_even NOT_finish NOT_the NOT_movie . . . 
i couldn't NOT_take NOT_it NOT_anymore . 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie . 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff . 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick again . 
( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little . 
he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't NOT_his NOT_best , was the only saving grace of the movie )
