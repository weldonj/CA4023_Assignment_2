here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . 
now if that isn't NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_get NOT_you NOT_to NOT_finally NOT_see NOT_a NOT_van NOT_damme NOT_movie , i don't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_is . 
all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . 
van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . 
van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . 
the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . 
once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . 
jean-claude's acting abilities don't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_usual NOT_lackluster NOT_standards NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie . 
in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . 
on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . 
sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . 
she is actually a decent actress , but didn't NOT_improve NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_i NOT_thought NOT_she NOT_would NOT_after NOT_species . 
this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . 
nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_every NOT_other NOT_van NOT_damme NOT_movie . 
simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . 
it has a retread plot -- this isn't NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time NOT_jean-claude NOT_has NOT_played NOT_twins . 
he still can't NOT_act . 
we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . 
this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par .
