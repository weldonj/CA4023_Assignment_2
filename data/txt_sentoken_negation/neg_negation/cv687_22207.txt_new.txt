an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . 
the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . 
more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . 
even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . 
although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . 
the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . 
if it weren't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_cutting NOT_edge NOT_makeup NOT_effects NOT_used NOT_in NOT_the NOT_werewolf NOT_transformation NOT_it NOT_is NOT_most NOT_likely NOT_that NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_film NOT_that NOT_would NOT_have NOT_gone NOT_largely NOT_unnoticed NOT_when NOT_it NOT_was NOT_released NOT_back NOT_in NOT_1980 . 
and with good reason -- the acting isn't NOT_great NOT_and NOT_neither NOT_is NOT_the NOT_writing . 
well ok , we don't NOT_actually NOT_expect NOT_either NOT_of NOT_those NOT_things NOT_to NOT_be NOT_great NOT_in NOT_a NOT_horror NOT_film . 
but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't NOT_scary . 
with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . 
you don't NOT_even NOT_need NOT_the NOT_obligatory NOT_scary NOT_music NOT_to NOT_give NOT_you NOT_a NOT_hint . 
i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . 
but john , it just wasn't NOT_scary . 
i didn't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_this NOT_was NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_be NOT_some NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_romantic NOT_drama NOT_and NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_werewolf NOT_thing NOT_was NOT_just NOT_thrown NOT_in NOT_to NOT_get NOT_people NOT_to NOT_come NOT_to NOT_the NOT_theater NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it , but it didn't NOT_work NOT_for NOT_me . 
actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . 
but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . 
it's never a good sign that you don't NOT_realize NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_funny NOT_until NOT_after NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_long NOT_over NOT_and NOT_you NOT_read NOT_it NOT_in NOT_the NOT_background NOT_material . 
call me crazy , but you shouldn't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_do NOT_research NOT_on NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_to NOT_enjoy NOT_it . 
i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . 
werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . 
boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . 
including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . 
the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . 
i know it sounds strange , but it actually works . 
the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . 
as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . 
while they are still impressive today , they aren't NOT_impressive NOT_enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . 
and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . 
actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't NOT_take NOT_itself NOT_as NOT_seriously NOT_and NOT_actually NOT_provides NOT_a NOT_few NOT_more NOT_laughs NOT_along NOT_the NOT_way .
