the best thing about , " lake placid " is that it's only 80 minutes long and when it's over you're glad that you didn't NOT_waste NOT_more NOT_than NOT_an NOT_hour NOT_and NOT_a NOT_half NOT_of NOT_your NOT_time . 
it's nothing more than a bad rip-off of , " jaws " ( and i think that's being kind . ) 
it was written by david e . kelly ( " ally mcbeal " ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably . 
i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . 
the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , " anaconda . " 
the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . 
that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . 
also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . 
soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . 
there's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . 
as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don't NOT_go NOT_for NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_approach NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_material NOT_but NOT_they NOT_also NOT_don't NOT_have NOT_anything NOT_sly NOT_or NOT_satirical NOT_or NOT_witty NOT_to NOT_say NOT_either . 
the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they're all basically idiots . 
if they had any brains the croc wouldn't NOT_have NOT_been NOT_that NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_challenge NOT_to NOT_catch NOT_and NOT_they NOT_wouldn't NOT_have NOT_put NOT_themselves NOT_in NOT_half NOT_of NOT_the NOT_situations NOT_that NOT_they NOT_did . 
but then again , if they were smart there wouldn't NOT_be NOT_a NOT_movie . 
basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .
