## OVERVIEW

In this assignment I attempt to improve a baseline sentiment analysis set up by experimenting with various algorithms and various different approaches and set ups

### Approaches and Structure

**Baseline -**

Replicate the provided Notebook which contains a Baseline Naive Bayes Setup

**Negation Handling -**

Introduce Megation Handling to the dataset (attempt to handle cases such as "don't skip this movie" being wrongly viewed as negative)

**Bigrams -**

Experiment with using word pairs instead of single words

**Trigram -**

Experiment with using groups of three words instead of single words

**Negation Handling alongside Bigram -**

Experiment with using both Negation Handling and Bigrams

**Lexicon Setup -**

Attempt a totally different approach that essentially ignores the labels on our dataset and attempts to classify the documents' sentiment by comparing the documents to a comprehensive sentiment lexicon

**Overall Results -**

A summary of the overall results, comparing all set ups, approaches and models

**Best model -**

The best model and setup that I found, with instructions on how to use it for the Hidden set
